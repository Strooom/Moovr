Next Steps :
* add timeouts in case motors are not running
Todo : think about how to handle errors
* not reaching the closing or opening of a switch (in time / in space)
* receiving events on other switches than the one monitoring


TODO : we need to capture the position on the opening of the switch as the ZERO
